# Sage_Work
This will contain work as I start to use and master SAGE, now SageMath, based on PYTHON.

I'm a 54 year old high school math teacher who wants to update and upgrade my skills. I was part of the last group that competed with sliderules in Texas UIL (University Interscholastic League) competitions during the 1978-1979 school year.

Although I did some programming in BASIC prior to the Macintosh's release, I haven't done any programming since.
My master's thesis, however, did focus on expert systems and computational linghistics; so I didn't somehow drop technology or computers like a hot potato.
